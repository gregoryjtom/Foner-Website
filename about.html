    		<p>
        In the modern world, our ability to communicate with others in real-time is greater than ever before. We have a plethora of mediums for this purpose: phone call, Skype, Zoom, Messenger, and many others. However, these platforms are predicated on the assumption that people communicating with each other are speaking the same language.

        As globalization of the world increases, we cannot make such an assumption. Therefore, the need for a service to quickly translate calls is paramount. For example, if I am a Spanish speaker in LA having a telemedical call with a physician that only speaks English, I would not want to put every sentence that I want to say into an online translating service, then try and speak that sentence to the doctor. </br></br>

        <em>Our service solves issues like this one by leveraging Twilio API and Google Translate API to translate phone calls in real time. </em>In our example, all the patient would have to do is call a phone number provided by the physician for spanish speakers and the physician would receive a call with the translated message. 

        You can imagine a number of more uses that one would have for our service. A Korean speaker calling an English-only pharmacy, a French businessman calling a Japanese supplier, and many more possibilities. The best part about our technology is that it doesnâ€™t rely on the users having internet service, but would work with just phone service. This would make it viable even in countries with less developed internet infrastructure, a feature that cannot be found in any competing software.
